https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_7+3T2015+type@asset+block/6001x_syllabus.pdf

Welcome to 6.00.1x! In this course you’ll be learning the basics of computer
programming in Python and the fundamentals of computation, as well as getting the
opportunity to implement your own Python functions.
This course is offered online and we understand that there are many opportunities
available to cheat. We caution you to not do so. You will learn less and only harm
yourself by cheating. We ask that you review our collaboration and forum guidelines,
available on the course handouts page, to understand how we expect our students to
conduct themselves in this course. Additionally all students are expected to follow the
edX Honor Code, available at https://www.edx.org/honor
Grading Policy
In this course there will be many types of assignments. Your final grade will be a
weighted average of the following:
 Finger exercises (available within each lecture video sequence) – 10%
 Problem sets – 40%
 Quiz – 25%
 Final exam – 25%
In order to earn a certificate for 6.00.1x, students must pass the course with a grade of C
or better. The following grading breakdown will apply:
 >= 80%: A
 >= 65%: B
 >= 55%: C
Exercises and Exams
All course material will be released at 14:00 UTC. Finger exercises have no due date, but
we encourage students to complete them as they view the lectures. See the Calendar
tab for Problem Set due dates. Regrettably, extensions are unavailable for any
assignment.
All problem sets will be due at 23:30 or 11:30 pm UTC. This is the Coordinated Universal
Time, also known as the Greenwich Mean Time. Convert to your local time zone using
an online converter such as this one:

Exams are scheduled in advance. The exams will take place online, on the course
website.
 The Quiz will take place from September 25 (14:00 UTC) to September 28 (23:30
UTC).
 The Final Exam will take place from October 23 (14:00 UTC) to October 27 (23:30
UTC)
During the exam period, the forums will be shut down. You will still be able to read
posts but you will not be able to post any questions. The honor code prohibits students
from communicating with one another during the exam period in any way whatsoever –
so please don’t discuss the exam on any other forum, website or in person with anyone
else.
